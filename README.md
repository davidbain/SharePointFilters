# SharePointFilters
A-Z filter buttons for SharePoint

These filter buttons allow you to filter a SharePoint list by item name. For example, selecting A shows all items 
starting with 'A'. They work by modifying the simple SharePoint URL to filter the list, meaning a filtered list is
also shareable via it's page URL. 

The buttons include their own CSS so the way they look (seen below) can be changed easily. Javascript is used to generate the buttons, instead of having a block of code for each letter.
